# # # By solving problems in this progressive manner, you'll not only learn Python but also strengthen your problem-solving skills, which is essential for Data Science.

# # now one by one suggest me the problem from every single topic like -Basic Syntax and Data Types (10 problems)there 10 problem assist me if I'm wrong then help to figure out the problem


# # Hello, World! Program
# # Task:
# # Write a Python program that prints the phrase "Hello, World!" to the console.

# # Concepts Covered:
# # Basic syntax
# # Using the print() function to output text
# # Solution Example:
# # python
# # Copy code
# # This program prints Hello, World!

# print("Hello, World!")
# print("this is jarvis speaking sir")


# # Problem 2: Simple Input/Output
# # Task:
# # Write a Python program that asks the user for their name and prints a greeting message.

# # Concepts Covered:
# # Taking input from the user using input()
# # Concatenating strings
# # Printing output
# # Example:
# # python
# # Copy code
# # Ask the user for their name

# # name = input("Enter your name: ")

# # # Print a greeting message
# # print("Hello, " + name + "! Welcome to Python programming.")

# # print("enter the text you want to print")

# # text = input("Enter the text: ")

# # print("this is the example of the text",text)


# # nmae = (input("enter your name"))
# # print(nmae, "Enter your name")




# # Problem 3: Simple Calculator
# # Task:
# # Write a Python program that asks the user for two numbers and then prints the sum of those numbers.

# # Concepts Covered:
# # Taking input from the user using input()
# # Converting string input to integers or floats using int() or float()
# # Performing basic arithmetic operations
# # Printing output
# # Example:
# # python
# # Copy code
# # # Ask the user for two numbers
# num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
# num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# # Calculate the sum
# sum_result = num1 + num2

# # Print the result
# print("The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is:", sum_result)
# # Explanation:
# # input() takes user input as a string. We use float() to convert the input to a floating-point number, so the program can handle both integers and decimal numbers.
# sum_result = num1 + num2 
# # performs the addition.
# # The result is printed using the print() function, which combines variables and strings to display the output.
# # Try it out and see how it works! Let me know when you're ready for the next problem.
